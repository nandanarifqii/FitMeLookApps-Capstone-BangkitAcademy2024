<p align="justify">FitMeLook is an Android mobile application that aims to assist women in finding clothing styles that suit their face shape and skin tone based on 4 seasonal color theory. This project utilizes image recognition technology to provide personalized recommendations. Users can either take a photo or select one from their gallery, and our system will analyze facial features to detect the user's skin tone based on 4 seasonal colors: winter, summer, spring, and autumn, as well as face shapes such as heart, oblong, round, and square. Based on the collected data, our application offers clothing recommendations tailored to ensure users can easily find attire that complements their features. Our primary goal is to boost users' confidence in their daily attire choices, making them feel more comfortable and self-assured. Through this approach, we hope to help women express themselves through clothing styles that reflect their unique characteristics.</p>
